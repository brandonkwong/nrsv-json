# nrsv.json

ðŸ“– Delivering the NRSV Bible translation to JSON.

## Getting Started

Download [nrsv.json](dist/nrsv.json) or fork this project to get started on sharing the gosepl in a lightweight data-interchange format. Just `yarn install` and run the following to build locally:

```
yarn build
```

### Build Options

An `--indent` option can be used to adjust spacing (default is `4`) for desired level of readability. This is particularly useful while editing the JSON [structure](src/lib/structure.js).

```
yarn build --indent 2
```

Alternatively, [nrsv-map.json](dist/nrsv-map.json) may also be built for easier lookup purposes. For example, `books.rom.chapters[14].verses[4].text` would return "".

```
yarn build --map
```

For distribution, [nrsv.json](nrsv.json) is stringified with `0` spaces.

```
yarn build --dist
```
